Welcome to the 8th bi-annual 3D Community Challenge. The "Eternal Ascent" concept came from a collaberation between myself and Gavin Shapiro. We combined Gavin's love for infinitely looping landscapes, and my love of travel/rock climbing. We hope you guys like it and I can't wait to see what you create this month!

As usual, the goal is to take the bare-bones 3D template, let your imagination soar, and build out a unique 3D world of your choosing. This challenge is for newcomers to 3D art, and long-time practioniors. We do these challenges to have fun, and learn and grow together as a supportive community, and in the end, all of our hard work will be put together into a couple epic montages on youtube.com/pwnisher.
Use my "Create With Clint" Discord server as a tool to help you through this challenge month. Myself and the Admins built out a "get started" page full of FAQ's and Guidlines" an "Announcements" page with vital information to ensure you're guided through the finsih line, and some "Working" channels as well. Every Monday we're doing virtual meetups to show off our WIPS and ask questions with myself, the admins and mods.

	Montage example - Just an example to showcase how each render will flow into the next in the final montages videos. 
                T-Pose files - incase you need T-pose data (which should already be baked into your project files) The original character animation was created using the Mixamo rig.
